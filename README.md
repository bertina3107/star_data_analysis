## Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing astronomical star data using Python and SQL to uncover patterns in star color distribution, detect anomalies, and extract meaningful insights. The first step involved data preprocessing and cleaning, ensuring accuracy and consistency in large astronomical datasets. Using image processing techniques, key features were extracted from astronomical images for in-depth research and analysis. Finally, data was aggregated and visualized using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, compiling a professional report that highlights trends, distributions, and outlier detection in star data.
